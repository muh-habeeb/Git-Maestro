# **App Name**: Git Maestro

## Core Features:

- Scrolling Narrative: Present Git and GitHub concepts in a continuous, scrollable format, guiding users through the learning process step-by-step.
- Interactive Code Blocks: Allow users to copy code snippets directly from the page to their clipboard.
- Animated Explanations: Incorporate subtle animations to enhance understanding, like visualizing commit history or branching workflows.
- Scroll Progress Bar: Implement a visual scroll progress bar to show users how far they've progressed through the tutorial.
- GitHub Portfolio Builder Tool: Based on your level of progress learning the material, the tool gives you a predicted competency score and also generates suggestions for content that should be in the GitHub portfolio. These may be specific examples of source code or general project ideas to flesh out the user's portfolio. 
- Quick Navigation: Add a fixed 'Jump to' menu for quick access to different sections.
- Hands-On Exercise: Include a practical exercise at the end, encouraging users to apply what they've learned by creating a repository, staging/committing changes, and pushing to GitHub.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Deep navy/charcoal (#0D0D1A) for a modern and immersive feel.
- Primary accent: Neon blue (#1FD2FF) for headings, code highlights, links, and buttons to draw attention.
- Secondary accents: Cyan (#61F1FF) and violet (#D06BFF) for highlights and gradients to add depth.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and shorter text passages, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to improve readability.  
- Use neon-blue tinted official Git and GitHub logos.
- Each content block occupies most of the viewport to create a focused reading experience.
- Headings slide/scale in, paragraphs fade up with stagger, code blocks glow, and images parallax slightly on scroll for visual engagement.
